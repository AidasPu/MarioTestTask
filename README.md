This is a task which I chose to learn more about ML how it works and what problems are there specifically for ML models. 
This was done in 3 days. Even if the goal I set up for the task was not achieved I learned a lot. 
Might come back with more knowledge to see how I'll be able to improve it.

To see how it works you have to setup a virtual environment `venv` and run command `pip install -r requirements.txt` which will install all dependencies. After that, I recommend starting main_v3.py as that is the last implementation. It can rerun best models to see how they perform by uncommenting the `play_best_network` function and picking your best_network_gen_`number`.npy file which is generated after every generation completes its run and just running play_best_network(`number`).
